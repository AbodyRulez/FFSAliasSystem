# FFSAliasSystem
Objective:

We've been suffering for a good amount of time with our admin panel and commands like /whowas or /whois, in order to search for certain players by their serial so they could get punished for whatever they've done.
Hopefully, this panel will make our life easier, specially when it comes to certain situations like tracing players' ban reasons by searching for their serial in ban list in order to take the right actions, and so much more!

Features:

Auto player join information capture "works on guests as well, captures serial and all other nicknames"
Auto player change nick capture.
Search for player by serial, nickname, or IP "by clicking on Search or pressing enter button"
Adding a reason to ban/mute is obligatory now.
Offline timed ban is now available.
Controlled grid list rows* explained below
Controlled penalty periods for cleaner database and wiser admin management.
Penalty periods:
Months: 12 - 6 - 3 - 1
Days: 15 - 7 - 3 - 1
Hours: 12 - 6 - 3 - 1
Minutes: 30 - 15 - 10 - 5
